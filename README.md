# Custom environment

This directory contains some custom config files for very common utilities that I use.
It also has some helper scripts that are useful on a Linux desktop.

## Things to note:

All the bin/git-\* scripts are for output to a shell prompt.
See the bashrc and ipenguin.zsh-theme for their use.

The vimrc is documented.
